\section{Manifold learning and representation}
Floyd-Warshall learning is like sampled manifold learning but where frequently visited paths are short-circuited with their weights learned especially.
The regions in the manifold are connected by a highway graph and 
% Proposed paper title:
% Monocular end-to-end mapping and navigation manifold learning.
% 1. Makes the map
% 2. Approximates the shortest distance with a given range of error threshold (D_\epsilon)
% 3. Creates multiple levels of graphs that are frequently re-used. It is not optimal because it is online and has initialization bias.
% 4. When manifold is being updated with new samples, the old regions of the curve should stay the same.
%    Only the regions that are being close to the new samples should change.

Why use neural networks? Why not use a mesh representation? How to compute gradient of the loss functions?
