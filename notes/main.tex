% Default for LaTeX is to allow up to 70% of the top of a page to be float (set by \topfraction as .7); up to 30% of the bottom of the page (set by \bottomfraction as .3) and at least 20% text (set by \textfraction as .2). Perhaps increase \topfraction using \renewcommand{\topfraction}{.75} as a start.
%  I was able to specify that only pages with more than 80% of floats, will become pure float-only pages. The default is 0.6 so if a figure consumes 60% of the page it will get its own float-page.

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

  What does it mean to think fast and slow?
  Thinking fast is the behaviorist model. A feed forward in the neural
  network without any recurrence.
  Thinking slow is the symbolic manipulation model.
  A probabilistic graphical model performing inference or performing
  long term planning on a graph whose local connectivity is known.
